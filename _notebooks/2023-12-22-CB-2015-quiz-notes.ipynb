    "When first analyzing this question, I first thought if a dice is 1 to 6, inclusive, it must contain integers 1 through 6. That must mean integers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, are included (which is 6 numbers). Therefore, options B and D should be out of the equation. I probably misclicked with B as I meant to select A. This means that we are left with options A, C, and E. The reason why I chose A initially is because I didn't see the word \"independent\", and therefore chosing A means that it would only generate 1 random int from the range (0 to 5, because of its index) and not 2 seperate dices. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are now left with 2 options, C and E. Both answers contain Math.random to generate a double value from 0 to 1. If we were to multiply by 6, we would get a range from 0 to 6. Transforming the value by using `int` will change the double value to an int value, and therefore changing the range to 0 to 5. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason the answer is not C, but E is because of the range. As mentioned above, the range will be from 0 to 5, granting only a dice that generates numbers from 0 to 5. Adding 2 will make up the range for 1 to 6 since adding 1 (2 times) will shift the dices range from 0-5 to 1-6. Essentially, the answer should be `1 + (int)(Math.random()*6) + 1 + (int)(Math.random()*6)`, but it is shortened to `2 + (int)(Math.random()*6) + (int)(Math.random()*6)`. \n",

    "### Glows:\n",
    "- Array List: My array list percentage grew from 50% to 67%. Although that doesn't sound like that big of an improvement, the number of questions are in play and the 2015 MCQ had 6 questions compared to 2014 MCQ's 4 questions. The biggest unit I struggled with was I think array \n",
    "\n",
    "- 2D Arrays: A major improvement was with my 2D arrays, as that was the biggest topic I struggled with in the 2014 MC. I previously had my mom help me understand the 2D arrays in the 2014 MC, which did help my understanding with 2D arrays. In the 2014 MC, I missed all 2 questions. In the 2015 MC, I only missed 1 out of the 4. There was definently an improvement in my understanding with 2D arrays. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Recursion: From the 2014 MC to the 2015 MC, my % correct with recursion jumped from 75% to 83%. This was additionally boosted by the fact that there were a greater number of recursion problems compared to the last exam. Although I missed a problem (question 38) that mainly focused on recursion, it had definently taught me to watch out for problems gave out big hints that it was on recursion. \n",

    "- Overall help: On this MC, I didn't recieve help compared to the 2014 MC, which I thought was a major improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grows:\n",
    "- Objects: As objects are throughout the entire course in CSA, I should not be missing on such a easy unit. Compared to the 2014 MC, I had the same % missed questions, but 2014 MC had double the # of questions. I have to mainly watch out for these questions, especially for dumb errors.\n",
    "- Boolean Expressions and if Statements: Boolean questions, especially including DeMorgan's laws, shouldn't be too hard. I messed up because I rushed through this section due to time.\n",
    "- Time: As we are given an hour and a half for the MCQ portion, I finished my test a bit over an hour. However, I feel like I spent way more time than I needed to on some questions. However, I think it comes down to understanding the material better.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall Analysis:\n",
    " Upon reflecting on my recent College Board test, I noticed a couple of areas where I need to up my game. Keeping an eye on object types and Boolean types, especially De Morgan's Law, is something I realized needs more attention. Arrays and array lists gave me a hard time in the last test, so I'm still working on getting the hang of them for the next one. On the bright side, I did see some progress in understanding arrays and recursion. Overall, I've got my sights set on smoothing out the rough spots and building on what's going well for better performance in the upcoming tests."
