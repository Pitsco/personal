Additionally, I set up the navbar, but that was all CSS and does not really count toward my part with javascript or java. Alex already talked to Mr. Mortensen about our team contributions, and I recognized that I need to step up my game in the next trimesters.\n",

Although I've not faced that yet, I should be more catious by committing more changes so I don't lose much progress if my commits don't process through.\n",

    "## Trimester 1 Reflection:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memories and Learning:\n",
    "- I have never touched Javascript or Java before, new experience\n",
    "- PBL learning with matching game, first full on experience with javascript code.\n",
    "- Mom and ChatGPT has really helped me understood java and javascript\n",
    "- Understanding deployment with AWS\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accomplishments:\n",
    "- More collaborative with team, understood my role as developer\n",
    "    - Development with backend with [AWS](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/teacher//c7.0/c7.1/c7.2/2023/09/27/aws-deployment_IPYNB_2_.html)\n",
    "        - Alex mainly helped me with development, followed instructions\n",
    "    - David helped me setting up VScode and cloning repositories in WSL, understood basic functions such as \"cd\" or \"gitclone\"\n",
    "    - Collaborated with Jishnu on frontend, about page and front page\n",
    "- Felt more engaged, spent more time coding than I have done in the past year in AP CSP\n",
    "\n",
    "### What I can improve on:\n",
    "- Contributing to more of the main project\n",
    "- Comitting more with less code > Committing less with more code\n",
    "- Touching more on backend, rather than just front end\n",
    "    - Something to do with machine learning in the next 2 tris (Alex's idea)? Sentiment Analysis?\n",
    "- Still be more engaged, sometimes I'm on my phone when I shouldn't be\n",
    "- Engagement of class lessons should be increased\n",
    "    - More particpation by raising hand\n",
