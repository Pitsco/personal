    "- This question involves reasoning about one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays of integers. You will write three static methods, all of which are in a single enclosing class, named DiverseArray (not shown). The first method returns the sum of the values of a one-dimensional array; the second method returns an array that represents the sums of the rows of a two-dimensional array; and the third method analyzes row sums.\n",

    "        int[] sums = rowSums(arr2D);\n",

    "In past MC's, I've had troubles with 2D arrays and iterating with them (especially with a for loop nested within another). It was quite hard understanding how they work. However, in this case, we are not iterating by row and column. Instead, we are checking whether any rows are equal. The reason why a nested for loop is used is to check the SPECIFIC rows, not columns. IF the sum of row[i] is equal to the sum of row [j], then the sums are marked false.\n",
