    "Compared to the first quesiton with arrays, I find this question a bit more trickier because it isn't as straight forward. It may seem confusing to someone who hasn't ever played this game. In question 1, it was just iterating through arrays and finding the sum of that array. Now, we are required to build classes with constructors and methods that iterate through for loops to find whether or not a character is valid. \n",

Instead, I used `StringBuilder` to easily modify the string after it has been constructed. \n",
