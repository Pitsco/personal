# Corrections:
## Question 9:
![d](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pitsco/personal/main/images/cb-corrections1.png)

When first analyzing this question, I first thought if a dice is 1 to 6, inclusive, it must contain integers 1 through 6. That must mean integers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, are included (which is 6 numbers). Therefore, options B and D should be out of the equation. I probably misclicked with B as I meant to select A. This means that we are left with options A, C, and E. The reason why I chose A initially is because I didn't see the word "independent", and therefore chosing A means that it would only generate 1 random int from the range (0 to 5, because of its index) and not 2 seperate dices. 

We are now left with 2 options, C and E. Both answers contain Math.random to generate a double value from 0 to 1. If we were to multiply by 6, we would get a range from 0 to 6. Transforming the value by using `int` will change the double value to an int value, and therefore changing the range to 0 to 5. 

The reason the answer is not C, but E is because of the range. As mentioned above, the range will be from 0 to 5, granting only a dice that generates numbers from 0 to 5. Adding 2 will make up the range for 1 to 6 since adding 1 (2 times) will shift the dices range from 0-5 to 1-6. Essentially, the answer should be `1 + (int)(Math.random()*6) + 1 + (int)(Math.random()*6)`, but it is shortened to `2 + (int)(Math.random()*6) + (int)(Math.random()*6)`. 

Down below I show a simple demonstration of how this works:


```java
System.out.println("Simplified Version");
public class DiceSimulationSimplified {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int die1 = (int)(Math.random() *6) + 1; //using Math.random function, we generate a random number from 1 to 6
        int die2 = (int)(Math.random() *6) + 1; //does it again
        int sum = die1 + die2; //adding both dies together

        System.out.println("The sum of two dice rolls is: " + sum);
    }
}
DiceSimulationSimplified.main(null);

System.out.println(" ");
System.out.println("Unsimplified Version");
public class DiceSimulationUnsimplfied {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int sum = 2 + (int)(Math.random() * 6) + (int)(Math.random() * 6);//combining both functions above

        System.out.println("The sum of two dice rolls is: " + sum);
    }
}

DiceSimulationUnsimplfied.main(null);
```

    Simplified Version
    The sum of two dice rolls is: 10
     
    Unsimplified Version
    The sum of two dice rolls is: 12


## Question 12:
![232](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pitsco/personal/main/images/cb-corrections2.png)

When I first initially solved this problem, I spent roughly 1 minute on it. It should not be that hard as it is a simple boolean expression. I kind of rushed through this problem without giving it enough thought. I did this problem again with the analysis down below.

### Here is a breakdown with step by step analysis:
Expression: (x && y) && !(x || y)

Let's assume x and y are both true

Step 1: `(x && y)` - If both x and y are true, `(x && y)` should result in the boolean value of true

Step 2: `(x || y)` - If both x and y are true, `(x || y)` should result in the boolean value of true (even if only one variable is true)

Step 3: `!(x || y)` - This means that if the expression `(x || y)` were to be true, then it would become false because of the "NOT" (!) operator. In our case, it would change (x || y) from becoming true to false

Step 4: `(x && y) && !(x || y)` - Combining it all together, we have the expression (x && y), which is true, and !(x || y), which is false, which would result in (true && false), which equals false. 

### This code also relates with DeMorgan's Law: 
![d](https://blog.penjee.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/demorgans-law-formula_all.png)

With the notation `!(x || y)`, DeMorgan's Law allows us to change that to `(!x && !y)`, which means if both x and y were set initially to true, that means both values would turn to false. If both x and y are false, then the expression `(!x && !y)` would result in false. 

### Down below I also show it with code:


```java
System.out.println("Simplified Example:" );
public class BooleanSimplifiedExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean x = true;
        boolean y = true;
        boolean result = (x && y) && !(x || y);
        System.out.println("Result: " + result);
    }
}
BooleanSimplifiedExample.main(null);

System.out.println(" ");
System.out.println("Unsimplified Example: ");
public class BooleanUnsimplifiedExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean x = true;
        boolean y = true;

        boolean result1 = (x && y); //Step 1 with the AND boolean expression
        boolean result2 = (x || y); //Step 2 with the OR boolean expression
        boolean result3 = !(result2); //Step 3 with the NOT boolean expression
        boolean result4 = (result1) && (result3); //Step 4 with the AND boolean expression

        System.out.println("Step 1: " + result1);
        System.out.println("Step 2: " + result2);
        System.out.println("Step 3: " + result3);
        System.out.println("Step 4: " + result4);
    }
}
BooleanUnsimplifiedExample.main(null);
```

    Simplified Example:
    Result: false
     
    Unsimplified Example: 
    Step 1: true
    Step 2: true
    Step 3: false
    Step 4: false


## Question 13:
![d](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pitsco/personal/main/images/cb-corrections3.png)


To be honest, when I first looked at the answer I chose, I don't understand why I chose that. The array I chose grew in increments of 3 for every index. The mystery value is equivalent to three, so I might have been confused with that. 

Now further analyzing the code, the answer should be A because if we were to test the first three index:

1st iteration:
k = 1, x = 3 because mystery(3) is called, so `numbers[1] = numbers[0] + 3` --> `numbers[1] = 17 + 3`, therefore the 1st index in the new array is 20.

2nd iteration:
k = 1 + 3, k = 4
k = 4, x = 3 because mystery(3) is called, so `numbers[4] = numbers[3] + 3` --> `numbers[4] = 42 + 3`, therefore the 4th index in the new array is 45.

3rd iteration:
k = 4 + 3, k = 7
k = 7, x = 3 because mystery(3) is called, so `numbers[7] = numbers[6] + 3` --> `numbers[7] = 48 + 3`, therefore the 7th index in the new array is 51.

The other numbers remain unchanged. 

Down below is code to show the process as well.


```java
public class MysteryArray {
    private int[] numbers;

    public MysteryArray(int[] numbers) { //constructor
        this.numbers = numbers;
    }

    public void mystery(int x) { //code from question
        for (int k = 1; k < numbers.length; k = k + x) {
            numbers[k] = numbers[k - 1] + x;
        }
    }

    public void printNumbers() { //printing the numbers not seperately, displays nicely
        for (int number : numbers) {
            System.out.print(number + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] initialNumbers = {17, 34, 21, 42, 15, 69, 48, 25, 39};
        MysteryArray mysteryArray = new MysteryArray(initialNumbers); //initializing new array, calling constructor

        System.out.println("Initial numbers:");
        mysteryArray.printNumbers();

        mysteryArray.mystery(3);

        System.out.println(" ");
        System.out.println("Numbers after mystery(3) is called:");
        mysteryArray.printNumbers();
    }
}

MysteryArray.main(null);
```

    Initial numbers:
    17 34 21 42 15 69 48 25 39 
     
    Numbers after mystery(3):
    17 20 21 42 45 69 48 51 39 


### Question 22:
![d](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pitsco/personal/main/images/cb-corrections4.png)


From further analysis, I realized that the answer is A, and not D. I redid it the first time and thought it was E, but then I realized the error I made.

How I thought it was D:
I did not fully realize that r = 0, meaning that if numbers[0].length was set to the row length, which is 3, that means the outside for loop would iterate 3 times. That would give an error because the there are only two rows in the 2D array. Down below, you can tell that the output goes from 1 to 2, then 4 to 5, because the code segment prints out 3 rows and 2 columns.


```java
public class AnswerChoiceD {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] numbers = {
            {1, 2, 3},
            {4, 5, 6}
        };

        try {
            for (int r = 0; r < numbers[0].length; r++) {
                for (int c = 0; c < numbers.length; c++) {
                    System.out.print(numbers[r][c]);
                }
            }
        } 
            catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
                System.err.println("Caught an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: " + e.getMessage()); //catches the out of bounds error
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
    }
}

AnswerChoiceD.main(null);
```

    	at java.base/java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:840)


How I thought it was E:
As I caught my mistake with D, I looked at E instantly because it swapped the column and rows. However, the reason why this answer is wrong because of the way it prints out. It starts with index 0 for both rows and then prints it out like that chronologically. Therefore, it will print out the value of 142536.


```java
public class AnswerChoiceE {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] numbers = {
            {1, 2, 3},
            {4, 5, 6}
        };
        
        for (int c = 0; c < numbers[0].length; c++) {
            for (int r = 0; r < numbers.length; r++) {
                System.out.print(numbers[r][c]);
            }
        }
    }
}

AnswerChoiceE.main(null);
```

    142536

The reason why the answer is E is because it uses an enhanced for loop to print out the numbers in each row in order. The outer for loop starts off by going through the first row by printing out the int `n` for each row. It does that until there are no more rows that are needed to be printed out.


```java
public class AnswerChoiceA {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] numbers = {
            {1, 2, 3},
            {4, 5, 6}
        };

        for (int[] row : numbers) {
            for (int n : row) {
                System.out.print(n);
            }
        }
    }
}

AnswerChoiceA.main(null);
```

### Question 26:
![d](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pitsco/personal/main/images/cb-corrections5.png)

To be honest I don't even know how I got this wrong. Did I misclick the answer? There was no point in selecting the option C as `String name = "blackboard"` was not modified at all.

This question goes back to my revisions in question 13 because it has the same printing format as the method `start()` in the question by using a for loop:



```java
public void printNumbers() { //printing the numbers not seperately, displays nicely
    for (int number : numbers) {
        System.out.print(number + " ");
    }
    System.out.println();
}
```

Down in the example class below, I used the code from the question and showed how it works. Going back to the explanation above, the String name "blackboard" is not passed through the `changeIt()` method, and therefore is not changed at all. However, if I were to set the string "word" to "blackboard", it would return the substring of it locally in the method. However, it would not change if it is called back into the method `start()`. Shown down below:


```java
public class Class {

    public static void changeIt(int[] arr, int val, String word) {
        arr = new int[5];
        val = 0;
        word = word.substring(0, 5);
        System.out.println("Word changed locally: " + word);

        for (int k = 0; k < arr.length; k++) {
            arr[k] = 0;
        }
    }

    public static void start() {
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        int value = 6;
        String name = "blackboard";
        String word = "blackboard"; //example where the string "blackboard" is passed through the method changeIt()

        changeIt(nums, value, name);

        for (int k = 0; k < nums.length; k++) {
            System.out.print(nums[k] + " ");
        }
        System.out.print(value + " ");
        System.out.print(name);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        start();
    }
}

Class.main(null);
```

    Word changed locally: black
    1 2 3 4 5 6 blackboard

### Question 30:
![d](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pitsco/personal/main/images/cb-corrections6.png)

This one is very easy as it is only asks for else if conditions. I most likely misclicked because it is very apparent that option 3 mixes the total cost of the boxes. Additionally, it states that `numBoxes > 0` so that condition will always be met. Option 1 is wrong because there is no else statement to prevent the next if statement from overriding the previous if statement.


```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class InkPenPricing {
    public static double getCostOptionI(int numBoxes) {
        double totalCost = 0.0;
        if (numBoxes >= 10) {
            totalCost = numBoxes * 1.50;
        }
        if (numBoxes >= 5) {
            totalCost = numBoxes * 3.00;
        }
        if (numBoxes > 0) {
            totalCost = numBoxes * 5.00;
        }
        return totalCost;
    }

    public static double getCostOptionII(int numBoxes) {
        double totalCost = 0.0;
        if (numBoxes >= 10) {
            totalCost = numBoxes * 1.50;
        } 
        else if (numBoxes >= 5) {
            totalCost = numBoxes * 3.00;
        } 
        else {
            totalCost = numBoxes * 5.00;
        }
        return totalCost;
    }

    public static double getCostOptionIII(int numBoxes) {
        double totalCost = 0.0;
        if (numBoxes > 0) {
            totalCost = numBoxes * 5.00;
        } 
        else if (numBoxes >= 5) {
            totalCost = numBoxes * 3.00;
        } 
        else if (numBoxes >= 10) {
            totalCost = numBoxes * 1.50;
        }
        return totalCost;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter the number of boxes: ");
        int numBoxes = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println("Option I: " + getCostOptionI(numBoxes));
        System.out.println("Option II: " + getCostOptionII(numBoxes));
        System.out.println("Option III: " + getCostOptionIII(numBoxes));
        scanner.close();
    }
}

InkPenPricing.main(null);
```

    Enter the number of boxes: Option I: 25.0
    Option II: 15.0
    Option III: 25.0


### Question 32:
![d](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pitsco/personal/main/images/cb-corrections7.png)


The variable "theMajor" is a string so a string compare must be done on the current instance of students in the array. They use the "getMajor" method to get the major from the students list.

Note that the "for" statement iterates over "students" and allows for a reference to an object of type "StudentInfo" inside the "for" block code. You can at get the class instance variables for each instance via calls to the methods for the class. Examples:

k.getAge();
k.getMajor();

If the instance of student matches the major passed into "averageAgeInMajor" method the code next gets the age from the current instance of students in the array using the "getAge" method.

The code:

sum += k.getAge();

adds the age into the sum variable. The count is incremented "count++;" to indicate the numbers of students to calculate the average for.


```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<StudentInfo> students = new ArrayList<>();
        students.add(new StudentInfo("Computer Science", 20)); //create a list of students
        students.add(new StudentInfo("Mathematics", 22));
        students.add(new StudentInfo("Physics", 21));
        students.add(new StudentInfo("Computer Science", 23));

        //creates an instance of the public class containing the averageAgeInMajor method
        StudentProcessor studentProcessor = new StudentProcessor(students);

        //calculates and prints the average age for Computer Science majors
        double averageAge = studentProcessor.averageAgeInMajor("Computer Science");
        System.out.println("Average age for Computer Science majors: " + averageAge);
    }

    public static class StudentInfo {
        private String major;
        private int age;

        public StudentInfo(String major, int age) {
            this.major = major;
            this.age = age;
        }

        public String getMajor() {
            return major;
        }

        public int getAge() {
            return age;
        }
    }

    public static class StudentProcessor {
        private List<StudentInfo> students;

        public StudentProcessor(List<StudentInfo> students) {
            this.students = students;
        }

        public double averageAgeInMajor(String theMajor) {
            double sum = 0.0;
            int count = 0;

            for (StudentInfo k : students) {
                if (theMajor.equals(k.getMajor())) {
                    sum += k.getAge();
                    count++;
                }
            }

            if (count > 0) {
                return sum / count;
            } else {
                return -1.0;
            }
        }
    }
}

Main.main(null);
```

    Average age for Computer Science majors: 21.5


### Question 33:
![d](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pitsco/personal/main/images/cb-corrections8.png)



For option I, max is initialized to the minimum value from the Integer class. That's good. Next, the for loop iterates through the array comparing max to value where value is the current value in the array. The variable max is replaced with value when max is less than value (meaning a new max value is found).

The reason why option II works the code is almost the same as option I but there's a flag used for the first pass through the for loop code. Since max is initialized to zero the initial "if" check works. the next "else if" would also work. The end result is the same as option I.

For option III, the variable max is initialized with the first value in the array. The "for loop starts at the second number in the array, which is at position 1. The "if" statement compares the max variable and the current instance of arr we are iterating over. the max variable is set to that instance if max is less. The end result is the same as option II and III.


```java
public class MaxFinder {
    
    public static int optionI(int[] arr) {
        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for (int value : arr) {
            if (max < value) {
                max = value;
            }
        }
        return max;
    }

    public static int optionII(int[] arr) {
        int max = 0;
        boolean first = true;
        for (int value : arr) {
            if (first) {
                max = value;
                first = false;
            } else if (max < value) {
                max = value;
            }
        }
        return max;
    }

    public static int optionIII(int[] arr) {
        int max = arr[0];
        for (int k = 1; k < arr.length; k++) {
            if (max < arr[k]) {
                max = arr[k];
            }
        }
        return max;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] exampleArray = {4, 8, 2, 10, 6};
        
        System.out.println("Max using approach I: " + optionI(exampleArray));

### Question 34:
![d](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pitsco/personal/main/images/cb-corrections9.png)

The "expression" code to set the sizeOfList int variable is "listOfWords.size()" This sets the sizeOfList variable to the true number of instances in the list. If there are four items in the list then it is set to four. This leaves you with options "b" or "d".

The reason why it is 
It's important to note that the code:

`listOfWords.size() - 1`

Could also be used for "expression" but the corresponding value for "condition" must also work.

Given the "expression" code is set the way that it is, the "condition" code is set check for the variable sizeOfList -1. This is important as the for loop starts at k = 0.

If you chose options "a" or "c" for "expression", the corresponding "condition" code for "a" definitely does not work. The first pass k = 0 so the first word would get missed. For option "c" the condition code of "k != sizeOfList - 1" would not work with the length set differently.


```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class WordsWithCommas {

    private List<String> listOfWords;

    public WordsWithCommas(List<String> listOfWords) {
        this.listOfWords = listOfWords;
    }

    public String wordsWithCommas() {
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder("{");
        int sizeOfList = listOfWords.size();

        for (int k = 0; k < sizeOfList; k++) {
            result.append(listOfWords.get(k));
            if (k != sizeOfList - 1) {
                result.append(", ");
            }
        }

        result.append("}");
        return result.toString();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage
        List<String> wordsList = new ArrayList<>();
        wordsList.add("Hello");
        wordsList.add("World");

        WordsWithCommas wordsWithCommas = new WordsWithCommas(wordsList);
        String result = wordsWithCommas.wordsWithCommas();

        System.out.println(result); // Output: {one, two, three}
    }
}

WordsWithCommas.main(null);

```

    {Hello, World}


### Question 38:
![d](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pitsco/personal/main/images/cb-corrections10.png)

Recursion is used here.

The first "if" block in the code checks to see if there is a match of the search variable (i.e. "v") to the last variable in the array (as indicated by numVals - 1). Note that because this is recursive each call to mystery will back up this up one lower in the array.

The second "if" block checks to see if the array is only one long. If that's the case, return and end. There is no more to process in the array.

The else of the second "if" block calls mystery again, but this time sets the numVals length one shorter. The mystery method runs again. If there is a match (i.e. first "if" block is true), k = 1 meaning that when the stack unwinds 1 will be added to the overall return value. The code...

return k + mystery(nums, v, numVals - 1);

Adds the returned "1" to the existing value if 'k' from the underlying call in the stack. This is how the code returns the number of elements in the variable numbers array that are equal to the value of the val variable. That is why the correct answer is c.


```java
public class MysteryClass {

    public static int mystery(int[] nums, int v, int numVals) {
        int k = 0;

        if (v == nums[numVals - 1]) {
            k = 1;
        }
        if (numVals == 1) {
            return k;
        } 
        else {
            return k + mystery(nums, v, numVals - 1);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage
        int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 5};
        int val = 2;
        int result = mystery(numbers, val, numbers.length);

        System.out.println("Number of elements in numbers that are equal to val: " + result);
    }
}

MysteryClass.main(null);
```

    Number of elements in numbers that are equal to val: 3

 Upon reflecting on my recent College Board test, I noticed a couple of areas where I need to up my game. Keeping an eye on object types and Boolean types, especially De Morgan's Law, is something I realized needs more attention. Arrays and array lists gave me a hard time in the last test, so I'm still working on getting the hang of them for the next one. On the bright side, I did see some progress in understanding inheritance and recursion. Overall, I've got my sights set on smoothing out the rough spots and building on what's going well for better performance in the upcoming tests.
