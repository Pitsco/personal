# Implementations at the Internship:
### Educational Content Creation:
- Develop tutorials and interactive presentations on sorting algorithms and Fibonacci sequences for inclusion in the computer science curriculum.

### Student Pathway Tracking System:
- Integrate sorting algorithm usage data into a system to monitor students' progress and provide insights for educators.
Recommendation for CompSci Pathway:
- Use sorting algorithms as a basis to recommend additional STEM courses and projects aligned with students' interests.
College Preparation Guidance:
- Offer guidance on how sorting algorithms relate to college credits and suggest AP exams based on students' proficiency.

### Student Pairing and Team Formation:
- Analyze sorting algorithm performance to recommend student pairing and team formations for collaborative projects.

### Skills Matching for Team Formation:
- Assess students' skills in sorting algorithms to match them effectively in teams, considering diverse perspectives.
