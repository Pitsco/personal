# 9.4 Super Keyword

## Using the super keyword to call a superclass's method.


```Java
public class Performer { //superclass
    public void practice(){
        System.out.println("Honing my craft!");
    }
    public void perform(){
        System.out.println("Performing for an audience!");
    }
}

public class Dancer extends Performer { //subclass
    public void perform(){
        System.out.println("Dancing on the stage!");
    }
}

public class BalletDancer extends Dancer { //subclass
    public void jete(){
        System.out.println("Leaping...");
    }
    public void pirouette(){
        System.out.println("Spinning...");
    }
    public void perform(){
        jete();
        pirouette();
    }
        public static void main(String[] args){
            BalletDancer derrick = new BalletDancer();
            derrick.practice();
            derrick.perform();
        }
}

System.out.println("BalletDancer class: ");
BalletDancer.main(null);
```

    BalletDancer class: 
    Honing my craft!
    Leaping...
    Spinning...



```Java
public class Performer { //superclass of Dancer class
    public void practice(){
        System.out.println("Honing my craft!");
    }
    public void perform(){
        System.out.println("Performing for an audience!");
    }
}

public class Dancer extends Performer { //superclass of BalletDancer class
    public void perform(){
        System.out.println("Dancing on the stage!");
    }
}

public class BalletDancer extends Dancer {
    public void jete(){
        System.out.println("Leaping...");
    }
    public void pirouette(){
        System.out.println("Spinning...");
    }
    public void perform(){
        perform(); //Why is this wrong?
        jete();
        pirouette();
    }
        public static void main(String[] args){
            BalletDancer derrick = new BalletDancer();
            derrick.practice();
            derrick.perform();
        }
}

System.out.println("BalletDancer class: ");
BalletDancer.main(null);
```

    BalletDancer class: 
    Honing my craft!

    BalletDancer class:

    Performing for an audience!
    Dancing on the stage!
    Leaping...
    Spinning...


## Popcorn Hack
Create a subclass and a superclass by calling the methods from the superclass from the subclass using the keyword super.
