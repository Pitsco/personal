# Inheritance
- idea of a class "inheriting" properties from another class

### Ex:
- Vehicle Class
- A car is a type of vehicle
    - more of a "specialized vehicle"
- Bus
    - color could be a unique factor
- Train
    - Steam Engine Train
    - Diesel Engine Train

- you have a basic model that basic features such as engine, or color that all vehicles can inherit
- **Constructors are not inherited!**
    - Remember, constructors must be the name of the class, so if a constructor is "inherited", its class and the constructor name will not be the same!

- they may have special features

Hiearchy is created in this example.

- Superclass will give everytrhing below in the hiearchy is refered to the subclass

### Continued Example:
**Class Vehicle:**
- Name (String)
- make (String)
- model (String)
- Constructor: Vehicle (...)
- Method: moveForward()

**Class Vehicle is the superclass of class Train**

**class Train:**
- Name (String)
- make (String)
- model (String)
- Constructor: Train (...) //we would change this to Train instead of vehicle!
- Method: moveForward()

*new addition:*
- Conductor (String) //doesn't carry to the vehicle class, conductor is a **SUBCLASS** of vehicle class
- moveFoward() method is still called the same thing, but we want to change the code inside it
    - this is called overwriting!
    - Overwriting: Changing the subclass body of a method that is inherited from a superclass

**Class Train is the superclass of class DieselEngineTrain**

**class DieselEngineTrain:**
- Name (String)
- make (String)
- model (String)
- Constructor: DiselEngineTrain: (...) //we would change this to DieselEngineTrain instead of Train!
- Method: moveForward() //inherit the overwritten method!
- Conductor (String)


*new addition:*
- oilLevel (double) //additional field added


```Java
//structure of example above

class Vehicle {
    public String name;
    public String make;
    public String model;

    public Vehicle(...) {
        //implentation not shown
    }
}

class Train extends Vehicle {
    public String conductor;

    public Train(...){
        //implenatation not shown
    }

    public void moveFoward(){
        //do something else
    }
}

class DieselEngineTrain extends Train {
    public double oilLevel;

    public DieselEngineTrain(...){
        //implementation not shown
    }
}

//super(params) --> accesses the superclass's constructor
```


    |       public Vehicle(...) {

    illegal start of type

    

    |       public Vehicle(...) {

    <identifier> expected
